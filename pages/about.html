        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently we do not provide any third party advertisement on our website. No
            third party interference is yet
            allowed and hence there is no question of collecting any information from third party from our website. In

        <h3> Information Mangalwarpethcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal Obtains from Third Parties:</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently website is not collecting user information from third party. Only in
            case of Payment Gateway, the
            bank (who so ever provides the payment gateway services for online transaction) collects very critical
            information like Credit card or debit card number, Expiry date of credit card or debit card, Credit card or
            debit card holders name, amount deducted from their credit or debit account and any other relevant
            information which is must for online transaction. This information is collected by payment gateway service
            provider and this information along with your contact information may store with payment gateway service
            provider. Mangalwarpethcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal does not store your contact information and
            amount you donate or pay for various services or products. The payment gateway service provider sends the
            transaction number to Mangalwarpethcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal website on completion of payment
            procedure along with status of transaction (like success, cancel or error).</p>


        <h3> On Successful transaction of payment:</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case of successful transaction
        of payment for online
        facilities the Devotee will be given a unique acknowledgement ID. Devotee needs to use acknowledgement ID for
        all future references with Payment gateway. The amount will be deducted from Devotee’s respective bank and
        credited in the account of Mangalwarpethcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal account. The Devotee will get
        necessary entry in their passbook or bank statement directly from their bank. The exemption from income tax is
        not granted of donation made to Mangalwarpethcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal and is not refundable on any
        condition. Mangalwarpethcha Raja Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal does not provide receipt of payment, it will
        be provided by the third party payment gateway.

        <h3> On Failure of transaction of payment:</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devotee can edit/delete facilities
        from list of selected
        facilities at any point before making payment. Once Devotee navigates to payment gateway for making payment,
        entry for same will be stored with us. Devotee enters financial details in payment gateway and none of these
        details are stored with us. Only the final confirmation provided by payment gateway is stored. Payment for
        facility will be termed as completed and accepted by Mangalwarpethcha Raja Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal
        only after realization of amount from bank. Only the facilities for which Mangalwarpethcha Raja Raja Sarvajanik
        Ganeshotsav Mandal receives complete payment are subject to cancellation policies. Mangalwarpethcha Raja
        Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal does not own responsibility of any transactions for which payment is not completed
        and realized in Mangalwarpethcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal account from bank.

        <p>
        <h4> Final decision regarding any complaint about refund lies with Mangalwarpethcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav
            Mandal’s Secretary.</h4>
        </p>
        </p>
